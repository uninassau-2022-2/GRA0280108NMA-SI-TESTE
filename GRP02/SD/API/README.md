### Concept üìù: 

- This API register information for generate a complete report about the user attendance. Like a queue system. 
- In this queue will have 3 types of passwords, defined by prioritization of attendance. The types are:: 

       ‚Ä¢ Priority password
       ‚Ä¢ Exams password
       ‚Ä¢ General password

- Every password will show a specific numeration using this pattern YYMMDD-PPSQ, where: 

      YY: Year of issue
      MM: Month of issue
      DD: Day of issue
      PP: Type of priority this password have
      SQ: Number of the password by priority, restarts daily


- A report is also issued daily and mounthly, with: 

      ‚Ä¢ Quantity of passwords issued
      ‚Ä¢ Quantity of passwords attended
      ‚Ä¢ Quantity of passwords issued by priority
      ‚Ä¢ Quantity of passwords attended by priority
      ‚Ä¢ Datailed password report with number, type, date and time of the issue and attendance. Will have the information of wich
      ticket window was responsable for the attendance, if don't was attended to anyone this field will be empty.
      ‚Ä¢ Time of attendance report, because the time may change for each kind of password.
